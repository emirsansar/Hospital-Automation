# Hospital-Automation
A basic hospital management system with Java. <br>
I have used OOP principles, database systems (JDBC) and Swing libraries in this project. <br>
In this application, the chief physician can manage the doctors and clinics in the hospital.
Doctors can choose their working hours.
Patients can make an appointment and see their appointments. <br> <br>
